## 📌 The Transparency Crisis

### Problem Highlights:
- 🚨 **1 in 4** Pakistanis paid bribes for public services ([TI Pakistan 2023](https://www.transparency.org.pk))
- 💸 **$2.6B** lost annually to petty corruption in South Asia
- 🤐 **72%** of victims don't report due to fear of retaliation

### How We Help:
```diff
+ Real-time heatmaps of bribery hotspots
+ Department-wise corruption leaderboards
+ Secure anonymous reporting (No personal data collected)
```
